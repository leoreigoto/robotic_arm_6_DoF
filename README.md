### Control of a 6-DOF Robotic Arm 

<b>Objective</b>

To integrate a SolidWorks model of a real-world robotic arm into a simulation environment. This project will derive and implement algorithms for the Kinematics, Inverse Kinematics, Dynamics, and Inverse Dynamics of the robotic arm, enabling accurate position and motion control.

<b>Technologies and Tools</b>

Matlab, Simulink, Robotics, Control and automation Engineering, PID Controller

Inside the repository there are 2 version. One of them have the full project and the other one only contains the Forward Kinematics and trajectory planning (simpler approach).
I advice to simulate new tasks with the Forward Kinematics and trajectory planning before using the full version. It easier to debug this way.
